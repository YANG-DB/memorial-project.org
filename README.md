## 📖 Mission

The **Memorial Project** is dedicated to safeguarding and revitalizing the memory of Jewish life in Europe prior to and during World War II by combining historical scholarship with advanced artificial intelligence, AI-driven knowledge systems, and interactive digital experiences.

We believe Jewish remembrance must extend beyond dates, events, and tragedy. It must also preserve the cultural, social, intellectual, and everyday dimensions of Jewish life—families, traditions, education, creativity, faith, and community. Much of this lived experience was fragmented or erased by the Holocaust; our work aims to responsibly reconstruct and reconnect these lost contexts for future generations.

### Our Core Objectives

Through AI-driven knowledge reconstruction, we strive to:

- **Preserve** - Personal and collective Jewish histories across generations
- **Reconstruct** - Cultural and social connections disrupted by persecution and destruction
- **Enrich** - Historical records with context, relationships, and lived meaning
- **Create** - Accessible, interactive tools for education, research, and remembrance

### Our Commitment

Rooted in respect for survivors, their descendants, and historical truth, our project is committed to collaboration with educators, cultural institutions, memorial organizations, and scholars.

**Our goal is not only to remember what was lost, but to ensure that Jewish life, its depth, diversity, and humanity is understood, honored, and carried forward.**
